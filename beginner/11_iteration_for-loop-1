For Loops:
Every for loop question can be done using a while loop. The difference lies in the syntax.

For Loop provides a concise way of writing initialization, test condition, and increment/decrement statements in one line.

Syntax:
for(Initialization ; Condition ; Updation){
    // Body of the Loop
}


Working of For Loop:
Initialization expression is executed.

Condition is checked.

2.1 If it is true then control goes inside body of the loop.

2.2. If the condition is false, Loop will be terminated.

After execution update expression is carried out.

Again flow go back to Step 2 and check the condition.
If the condition evaluates to false, the loop is terminated else the body of the loop is again executed.

This process continues until the condition becomes false. If the condition never becomes false, it is the case of an infinite loop.

Example:

Let's understand For loop using a simple example.

Code1:

Print all numbers from 1 to 5.

for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
Dry Run:

i	i <= 5	println(i)	i++
1	true	1	2
2	true	2	3
3	true	3	4
4	true	4	5
5	true	5	6
6	false	-	-
Output:

[Success] Your code was executed successfully
1
2
3
4
5
Print all the numbers from N to 1.

Code:

Input: 10
Scanner scn=new Scanner(System.in);	

int N=scn.nextInt();

for(int i= N;i>=1;i=i-1){
System.out.print(i+" ");
}
Dry Run:

i	i >= 1	print(i)	i=i-1
10	true	10	9
9	true	9	8
8	true	8	7
7	true	7	6
6	true	6	5
5	false	5	4
4	true	4	3
3	true	3	2
2	false	2	1
1	false	1	0
0	false	-	-
Output:

[Success] Your code was executed successfully
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Infinite Loop:

Code:

for(int i=1;i <= 5;i--){
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}
Dry Run:

i	i<=5	print(i)	i - 1
1	true	1	0
0	true	0	-1
-1	true	-1	-2
-2	true	-2	-3
Explanation:

Since the condition is always true -> we will be stuck in an infinite for loop.
Handling Multiple Test Cases:
Code:

int T = scn.nextInt();		
for(int i = 1; i <= T; i++){
int n = scn.nextInt();
    //Do the task
}
Explanation:

Take "T" test cases from the user, start loop from 1 
and iterate till "i" value is <=T. 
Every value of "i" take a input from the user and perform the required task. 
Example:
Read T numbers and for every number print the last digit.

Input Format:
1st Line: Contains T
Followed by T lines containing the T numbers

int T = scn.nextInt();
for(int i = 0; i < T; i++) {
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    System.out.println(n%10);
}
Dry Run:
T=5,

i	i<5	int n = scn.nextInt();	println(n%10)
0	true	123	3
1	true	234	4
2	true	67	7
3	true	6	6
4	true	409	9
5	false	-	-
